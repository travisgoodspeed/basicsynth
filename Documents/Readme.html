<h1>BasicSynth Library</h1>

<p>The <em>BasicSynth</em> source is provided to support the book <em>BasicSynth: Creating a Music Synthesizer in Software</em>.
(see <a href="http://basicsynth.com">http://basicsynth.com</a>.) The book provides detailed explanations of the signal processing functions
required to generate and process sounds, and shows the derivation of the programs using the C++ language.
Although the book is not required to use and understand the source, it should be read first if you do not
have any experience with signal processing programming.</p>

<p>The <em>BasicSynth</em> source distribution contains the following parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common library - signal generation and processing library.</li>
<li>Instruments library - various synthesis instruments.</li>
<li>Notelist - a text-based music score language.</li>
<li>Examples and utilities - working programs that use the libraries.</li>
<li>BSynthComposer - a complete software synthesis program.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Common library</h3>

<p>The <em>BasicSynth</em> Common library  provides the signal generation 
and processing foundation for a software synthesizer. Much of the implementation 
is contained in the header files located in the Include directory. 
The file <em>BasicSynth.h</em> includes all of the header files, or individual files 
can be included as needed. The methods are typically short, and placing them
in the header allows the compiler to optimally expand the code as inline functions. 
Longer functions, and those that are not time critical, are located in the 
Src/Common directory and compiled into the Common library as object modules.</p>

<p>To build your own synthesis program with <em>BasicSynth</em> you need at a
minimum the Include files and the Common library (<em>Lib/Common.lib</em>). The Include
directory and the Common library provide the sound generation, wave file and
sequencer code. The header file <em>BasicSynth.h</em> includes all of the library.</p>

<p>Note: Libraries for GCC (including MINGW) have the <em>.a</em> extension instead of <em>.lib</em></p>

<h3>Instruments</h3>

<p>A set of example instruments built using the library are located in Src/Instruments.
The instruments are intended for use with BSynthComposer (see below) but can also
be used for other software synthesis systems.</p>

<p>If you want to use the <em>BasicSynth</em> instruments collection in your
program, you must also include the header file <em>Src/Instruments/Instruments.h</em> and link 
the <em>Lib/Instruments.lib</em> library.</p>

<h3>Notelist</h3>

<p>Notelist is a musician friendly, text-based music score format. It allows simple representation of notes, and
also includes programming functions to calculate note values. Notelist allows specifying synthesis
parameters on a note-by-note basis. This provides complete control of the sound, not simply note-on
and note-off specification.</p>

<p>To include the Notelist score processor in your program, you must include the header file
<em>NLConvert.h</em> from the <em>Src/Notelist</em> directory and link the <em>Lib/Notelist.lib</em>
library.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The source distribution includes numerous example programs that show usage of the library. 
The exmple programs are executed from the command line and are portable to many
platforms. Some examples are under the directory Src/Utilties. These are specific
to MS-WINDOWS.</p>

<h3>BasicSynth Composer</h3>

<p>The BasicSynth source is intended to provide examples to someone who wants to 
create a personalized software synthesizer, and should not be treated as a completed
synthesis project. However, a complete synthesizer (BSynthComposer) designed by the
author for his own use is also included. This can be compiled and run as-is, but is also
intended as a reference for how the BasicSynth libraries can be used as the foundation
for your own synthesizer.</p>

<p>Three versions of BSynthComposer are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - uses WTL for the GUI framework, GDI+ for graphics, DirectSound for audio.</li>
<li>FLTK - uses the FLTK for the GUI framework.</li>
<li>WX - uses wxWidgets for the GUI framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MSWIN version only compiles with Visual Studio and only runs on Windows. The FLTK and WX versions
can be compiled with the GNU or MinGW compilers and will run on Windows or Linux.</p>

<p>Several compositions for BSynthComposer are located in the ExampleProjects directory.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Reference documentation on the libraries is  built with Doxygen. Use the files in the <em>Doxygen</em> directory
to build the documentation .html files. In addition, documentation in Windows help file format can be downloaded from
the BasicSynth project on sourceforge.</p>

<h2> Building <em>BasicSynth</em></h2>

<p>The author's target development environment for <em>BasicSynth</em> is Windows using Visual Studio 2008.
Consequently, the build procedure receives much more use and testing on Windows than other environments. 
Compiling with makefiles or Code:Blocks, GNU C++, MINGW, and building
for Linux, may require some adjustments to make them work correctly on your computer.</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />

<h3>Building on MS-Windows with Visual Studio</h3>

<p>There are several solution files that can be built depending on what you want to do. 
Default solution files are for Visual Studio 2008 (i.e. version 9). Solution files with 2005
in the name are for VisualStudio 2005 (version 8). Visual Studio 6 project files (.dsp) are
also included. However, the older project files are not always kept up to date and you may
need to modify them to produce working versions on  the latest code.
The VirtualKBD utility and BSynthComposer will not build with version 6 as they need the gdi+ libraries. 
If you have a different version of the compiler, you will have to produce the project and/or solution files from one
of the supplied versions. Visual C++ Express edition will build most of BasicSynth without problems.
However, to build BSynthComposer, and the Utilities, you need ATL. ATL is not included with VC Express, but may be available in the Platform SDK.
</p>

<p>Each Visual Studio project defines four targets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Release Win32 - 32-bit version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug Win32 - 32-bit version with debugging.</li>
<li>Release x64 - 64-bit version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug x64 - 64-bit version with debug info.</p>
</ol>

<p>Output of the 32-bit release version is in Bin and Lib. The 64-bit version produces output in Bin64 and Lib64</p>

<p>To build everything, use the solution file <em>Src/BasicSynth.sln</em></p>

<p>To build just the libraries, use the solution files in <em>Src/Common,
Src/Instruments, and Src/Notelist</em> directories.</p>

<p>To build the Example programs, use the solution file in <em>Src/Examples</em>. This
builds all the example programs and libraries.</p>

<p>To build the utilities, use the solution file in <em>Src/Utilities</em>.</p>

<p>To build the stand-alone command line synthesizer, build the project in <em>Src/BSynth</em>.</p>

<p>To build the GUI synthesizer, build the project in Src/BSynthComposer</p>

<p>The utility programs and VC version of <em>BSynthComposer</em> use WTL 8.0, available on sourceforge.net.
The parts used by <em>BasicSynth</em> are located in the <em>OpenSource/WTL80</em> directory.
<em>BSynthComposer</em> requires the <em>scintilla</em> header files and library DLL, 
also available on sourceforge.net. The parts used by <em>BasicSynth</em> are located in the 
<em>OpenSource/scintilla</em> directory. Pre-built DLLs are installed in the <em>Bin</em>
and <em>Binx64</em> directories.</p>

<p>The fltk version of <em>BSynthComposer</em> requires the FLTK header and library
files. Source code is available from the <a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK website.</a>
</p>

<p>The wx version of <em>BSynthComposer</em> requires the wxWidgets header and library
files. Source code is available from the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets website.</a>
Use the 2.9.x version. To build wxWidgets, use the appropriate solution file in wxWidgets\build\msw directory.
The BasicSynth projects use a properties file (BSynthComposer\wx.props) to set the path to the wxWidgets
directory. The default is <em>basicsynth\OpenSource\wxWidgets-2.9.3</em>.
</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />

<h3>Building with Code::Blocks</h3>

<p>There are two Code::Blocks workspace files for BasicSynth. In the Src directory,
the basicsynth.workspace file will build the libraries and example programs. 
In the Src/BSynthComposer directory the BSynthComposer.workspace file will build the
synthesizer program using either FLTK or wxWidgets. </p>
<p>The Code::Blocks installer for Windows includes a version of MinGW32. However, you should not use
that version as it does not include the gdi+ libraries. Download and install the latest MinGW tools
and then change the path to the compiler in Code::Blocks to reference the MinGW\bin directory.
If you already have MinGW, check the include directory to insure that you have the gdiplus header files.
</p>

<p>Projects contain four targets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Release Win32 - 32-bit Windows version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug Win32 - 32-bit Windows version with debugging.</li>
<li>Release UNIX - Linux version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug UNIX - Linux with debug info.</p>
</ol>

<p>There is a .cbp project file for each of the libraries, example programs, FLTK and wx versions
of BasicSynth Composer. (The Utilities and MSWIN version of BasicSynth Composer use
ATL and must be compiled with VisualStudio, so no .cbp files are provided.) </p>

<p>A global variable <em>bshome</em> defines the location of  include and library files. The first time
you build the basicsynth workspace, Code::Blocks will prompt for the needed value.
You can also set this in advance from the <i>Settings:Global Variables</i> menu.

The bshome value is the top directory where BasicSynth is installed (the <i>basicsynth</i> directory).
It's best to put the source in a path without spaces since the MINGW compiler and linker
will have problems otherwise. However, if the path has spaces in it, there are ways
around the problem. For Windows, you can create a network share name for the root folder and 
use the UNC path to access it. (e.g. \\MYCOMPUTER\BasicSynth). </p>

<p>When compiling on Linux the projects use the appropriate config file to determine the
path for include and library files for wxWidgets and FLTK. When compiling on Windows 
you must set a variable for the path.
</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />

<h3>Building with Makefiles</h3>

<p>There is a master Makefile located in the Src directory. This will build the libraries
and example programs. There is also a Makefile in each directory that can be used if
you only want to build part of the system. </p>
<p>The file <em>BasicSynth.cfg</em> in
the Src directory contains the settings for the compiler and linker. 
Edit BasicSynth.cfg to point to the appropriate places. Usually you will only need to change
the location of BSDIR in case you put the source in a directory other than your
home directory. By default, BasicSynth is built with XML support using the
tinyxml code in the Common directory. If you want to build with libxml2, 
you must install the libxml2-dev package and set the value in the BasicSynth.cfg 
file first before building BasicSynth. If you do not need to use the project/instrument file
loading code, there is a null implementation of the XmlWrapper class that can
be used instead. The file is Src/Common/XmlWrapN.cpp.</p>

<p>Output is to the directories Bin and Lib under the BasicSynth install
directory. (Note the capitalization!)</p>

<p>There is a Makefile in <em>BSynthComposer</em> that will build the
FLTK and wx versions of BasicSynth Composer. There are install targets,
installwx and installfltk, to install the binaries. You must <em>su</em> to root
for the install make.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'></span></em> I have noticed
a problem with the GNU make that causes make to halt when descending three
directory levels. Running make with the command line argument
<em>--no-print-directory</em> fixes this.</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />

<h3>Building with MINGW</h3>

<p>The makefiles will work with MINGW if you also install MSYS. 
However, a different configuration file is used for mingw on Windows. 
Copy BasicSynth.mingw to BasicSynth.cfg before running make.</p>

<p>Compiling BSynthComposer with mingw presents
some difficulties. To get high quality graphics, BSynthComposer for wxWidgets uses
the GDI+ library, but this is not included with MINGW. It is possible to 
compile without GDI+, however. Set wxUSE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=0 when
building wxWidgets to avoid this problem. Alternatively, you can
get the GDI+ header files from the Windows SDK, edit them to work
with mingw, then create an import file (libgdiplus.a) to reference the
GDI+ dll.
</p>

<p>When compiling the FLTK version of BSynthComposer, you
will also need a regex library. Source to regex is included under the
OpenSource directory. Compile the library and then copy to the MINGW 
library directory if needed.
</p>

<h2>Utility Programs</h2>

<p>The utility programs can be used to interactively explore various synthesis and signal processing
techniques. These programs are built with Visual Studio on Windows and are not currently available
in a portable version. The compiled files can be downloaded separately as a Windows .msi install file.</p>

<h3>Waveform Explorer</h3>

<p>This program allows setting each of 16 partials to construct a complex
waveform using the inverse Fourier transform (sum of sine waves). The resulting
waveform can be saved to disk as a WAV file and as a graphic (EMF). Settings
can be copied to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>FM Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a three oscillator FM synthesizer. Each oscillator
is combined with an ADSR envelope generator. Several presets are available as
examples. The program can save the sound to a WAV file. The settings can also be
copied to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Reverb Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a Schroeder reverb. The loop times and reverb time
can be set from the program to hear how they affect the sound. Sounds can be
internally generated or loaded from a WAV file. The processed sound can be
saved to disk.</p>

<h3>Flanger Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a Flanger/Chorus effect. The delay times, modulation
depth, and amplitudes can be set to hear how they affect the sound. Sounds can
be internally generated or loaded from a WAV file. The processed sound can be

<h3>MIDI Player</h3>

<p>This program uses the GMSynth DLL to produce a MIDI file playback
program using either SoundFonts or DLS files to define instruments. A virtual
keyboard allows playing the sounds interactively. MIDI keyboard input is 
also provided. Output can be sent directly to the sound card or to a WAV file.</p>

<h2>BSynthComposer</h2>

<p>This program is a complete GUI synthesizer with mixer, wavetable editor, instrument editors, 
interactive playback using a virtual keyboard, MIDI keyboard input, and text score editor. The 
synthesizer can generate a WAV file or send output directly to the sound card. Three versions
currently exist, a native Windows implementation, a portable implementation using FLTK, and 
a portable version using wxWidgets. On-line help and several example compositions are include
to help get you started using the synthesizer.
