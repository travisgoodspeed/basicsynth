Step VIII - Add another voice to the score</h1><hr/>
<p>
Double click on the Score project item to open the editor for the Steps score. Move
to the bottom of the file and add the following lines.</p>
<pre>

voice 2
begin
    instrument &quot;Plunk&quot;;
    channel 1;
    volume 100;
    C2, %1, 100;
    B1, %2, 100;
    G2, %2, 100;
    D2, %4, 100;
    E2, %4, 100;
    F2, %4, 100;
    G2, %4, 100;
    C2, %1, 100;
end

</pre>
<p>
Save the file and then play the score again. This time you will hear two voices
played together. Now add the following to the score:</p>
<pre>
map &quot;Plunk&quot; &quot;oscmnx&quot;;

voice 2
begin
    instrument &quot;Plunk&quot;;
    channel 3;
    volume 100;
    C2, %1, 100, 0.5;
    B1, %2, 100, 0.7;
    G2, %2, 100, 0.9;
    D2, %4, 100, 1.2;
    E2, %4, 100, 1.4;
    F2, %4, 100, 1.6;
    G2, %4, 100, 1.8;
    C2, %1, 100, 2.0;
end
</pre>
<p>
The &quot;map&quot; line tells Notelist that the first value after the volume is
an instrument parameter and should be passed to the instrument as the oscillator
modulation index value. Notelist allows setting almost any instrument parameter
on a note-by-note basis. In fact, you can skip editing the instruments completely
and specify all instrument parameters in the score. However, the normal case is
that only a few parameters will be varied in the score. Configuring the instrument
first means that we only have to enter the parameters that are changing during playback
into the score.</p>
<p>
Also change the channel number for voice 1 to channel 2. Remember that we set channel
2 and 3 to pan left and right. Play the score again and listen to the bass line
become brighter on each note.
