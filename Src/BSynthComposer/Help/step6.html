You can either play the sound directly through the computer's sound card, or can
generate an output file to be played by some other program. In addition, you can
select a portion of the composition using the From and To values. For now, select
the speaker button on the form to send the output to the sound card and select All
to play all of the composition. Press the Start button to begin playback. You should
hear a scale played back. When the sound is finished, press the Close button on
the form.

</b>from the menu to do this.</p>
