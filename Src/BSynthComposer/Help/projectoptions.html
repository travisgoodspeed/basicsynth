<h1>Project Options<hr/></h1>
<p>The Project Options form is used to set options for the synthesizer that apply to all projects. The values in this form are stored
when the program exits and reloaded when it starts. Some values (such as the Forms directory) are not changed immediately.
They are applied when a new project is opened.</p>

<p>
The <b>Composer</b> field sets the default composer name. The <b>Copyright</b> field sets the default copyright notice.
These values are used to initialize a new project.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Project Tree Options</b> buttons select optional features of <i>BasicSynth</i> that will appear in the project tree view.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Notelists</b> shows the notelist file entry in the tree.</li>
<li><b>Sequences</b> shows the sequencer file entry in the tree.</li>
<li><b>Script files</b> shows an entry for scipt files. Script files are short programs that are processed
by the synthesizer. (These are not yet implemented.)</li>
<li><b>Text files</b> shows the text file entry in the tree. Text files are used to asscociate generic 
text files with the project. These can be used to hold program notes, etc.</li>
<li><b>Libraries</b> shows the Library file entry in the tree. Libraries are collections of instruments.</li>
<li><b>SoundFonts</b> shows the Sound Bank file entry in the tree. Enable this if you want to use
sound bank instruments.</li>
<li><b>MIDI</b> shows the MIDI entry in the tree. This is used to set default program and volume
levels for MIDI channels. It is only needed if you have a MIDI keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <b>Projects</b> field contains the default directory for project files.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Wave-In</b> field contains the default directory for WAV files used by the WFSynth insrument.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Forms</b> field contains the default directory for instrument form files. Normally this value is
set at installation and should not be changed. However, it is possible to create custom versions of the
instrument editor forms and then change this value to the alternate directory.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Colors</b> field contains the file containing color definitions for instrument forms. Various
colors files are located in the Forms directory. A custom colors file can be used to set a color
scheme preferred by the user. Copy one of the existing files and change the colors as desired.
If the colors file is not a full path, it is assumed to be in the Forms directory.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Libraries</b> field contains the default directory for instrument library files.
</p>
<p>
The <b>MIDI In</b> field allows selection of the MIDI input device.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Wave Out</b> field allows selection of the wave output device (sound card).
</p>
<p>
The <b>Play Latency</b> field contains the value in seconds for playback latency. A longer latency time
creates a larger buffer for sound output. A larger buffer helps to prevent glitches in sound output,
but produces a longer delay between sound generation and sound output. A value of 1 to 0.1 seconds
is typical. The minimum value varies depending on the sound card and driver, but is generally around 20ms.
The wave output module may select a value higher than configured if the value is too short. Note: the
keyboard player does not use this setting. They keyboard will use the smallest possible
latency available in order to minimize delay between key down and sound output.</p>
<h3>Options File</h3>
<p>
The values entered in the project options dialog are saved and reloaded the next time
<em>BasicSynth Composer</em> is started. On Windows versions, the settings are stored in the
registry user HKLM\Software\BasicSynth. On other versions the settings are stored in a file
in the user's home directory. Each line in the file contains the option name, an equal sign, then the
option value. This file can be edited directly if needed. It can be copied to another computer to
transfer the options.
