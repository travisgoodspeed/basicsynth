Right-click the <b>Notelist</b> project item and select <b>New</b> from the pop-up menu. The Notelist
file properties form is displayed. Enter "Steps" for the name and "steps.nl" for the
file and press <b>OK</b>. The Notelist editor is opened. The Notelist editor is a
text editor with syntax high-lighting. Keywords are shown in blue, while delimters
are red. The editor uses the standard editing keys for Windows and also includes
Find and Replace capability.</p>
<p>
Type (or copy) the following into the editor. Be careful to include all punctuation exactly as shown.

A Notelist score consists of one or more voices, each containing one or more notes.
A Notelist voice is similar to a staff in traditional music notation. Notelist automatically
calculates the start time for each note by adding the duration of the previous note
to the current time. It is not necessary to specify the exact start
and stop time for each note. (There are ways to do this if needed.) Each voice
must be given a number, but the numbers do not have to follow in order or be limited
to any particular range. You can create as many voices as needed and number them
anyway you want so long as the number is a positive integer value. The voice also
defines the instrument, mixer channel, volume level and other information about
the notes.
</p>
<p>
Each note consists of a pitch, rhythm, volume level and optional instrument parameters.
Pitches have a pitch letter, optional accidental (# or b) and octave number. Octave
4 is the octave of middle C. Rhythm values can be entered as absolute time in seconds,
or, as in the example above, with a rhythm value. A rhythm value is indicated by
a % sign followed by a number representing a fraction of a whole note. Thus, a value
of "%4" is equivalent to a quarter note. Volume levels (dynamics) are specified
with a value from 0 to 100 with 0 meaning silence and 100 the maximum level. The
actual volume level, however, will be modified by the mixer channel and may be softer
or louder than the value in the score. Instrument parameters follow the volume level
on the note line. This voice does not include any instrument parameters.</p>
<p>
Notice how each note is ended with a semi-colon and the values for the note are
separated by commas. These punctuation marks help Notelist identify the parts of
the note. A semi-colon is used to separate notes while a comma is used to separate
values. This allows multiple notes to be placed on one line, or one note to span
multiple lines. In other words, Notelist treats the end of line as if it was a space.
You can add or remove spaces freely to suit your tastes.</p>
<p>
It is also possible to place multiple notes on one line using braces around the
notes. See the <a href="notelist.html">Notelist documentation</a> for information
on this and other features of Notelist.</p>
