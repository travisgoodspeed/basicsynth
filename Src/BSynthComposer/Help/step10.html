<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>
Be sure to save the project from time to time. If you have unsaved changes when you exit 
from the progam, a prompt will appear asking you if you want to save the changes. If you
say no, the changes since the last save will be discared. 
When you save a project, BasicSynth first creates a backup of the current file with <em>.bak</em> as the file extension. 
Should you decide the changes are not what you want, copy the backup file onto the project file and then reopen the
project.

These ten steps are all it takes to create music with Basic Synth. You can add more
wavetables, instruments and score files to create more complex songs, but the basic
procedure is as shown above.</p>
<p>
At this point you should study the documentation on <a href="notelist.html">Notelist</a>
and read about the various <a href="instruments.html">instruments</a> available in <i>Basic Synth</i>.
