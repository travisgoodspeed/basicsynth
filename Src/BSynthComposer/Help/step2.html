<h1>Step II - Create wavetables</h1><hr/>
<p>
Most sound generators in <em>Basic Synth</em> use pre-calculated tables to define
the waveform for the sound. Ten wavetables for common waveforms are created automatically, but
you will probably want to define wavetables specific to the sounds you create. To
add a wavetable, right-click on the <em>Synthesizer</em> project item and select <b>Add Wavetable
</b>from the pop-up menu. The wavetable properties box is opened.

<p>
Enter the name "Wiggly" for the waveform and then press <b>OK</b>. The waveform editor will open.</p>

<p>
(Because this editor is very wide, you may need to hide the project tree and keyboard panes to 
see the entire waveform at once. Select the <b>View</b> menu to hide or show panes.)</p>
<p>
Up to sixteen partials may be combined to produce the waveform. 
The buttons at the top enable each partial. Select partials 1, 2 and
3 and then use the knobs to set the amplitude for each partial. Set partial 1 to
1.0, partial 2 to 0.5 and partial 3 to 0.333.
To change a value with a knob, click the mouse on the knob and move the mouse in
a circular motion while holding down the mouse button. Moving clockwise increases
the value; moving counter-clockwise decreases the value. The label under the knob
shows the current value. Hold down the Ctrl key while moving the mouse to slow down
the speed of the knob. Hold down the Shift key to accelerate the knob. You can also
click on the label and enter the value directly with the pop-up form.</p>
<p>
Press the <b>Set</b> button when you have finished setting the partials. Until
you press <b>Set</b> the values are only stored in the project item. Set causes the wavetable
to be transfered into the synthesizer for use and also saves a copy of the 
current setting. (Most editors in <i>BasicSynth</i> make immediate 
updates to the synthesizer as you change values in the editor, and you will not have to save the settings to make them
active. Because the wavetable is calculated based on all partials, recalculation
of the waveform is delayed until you have finished entering the values.)
The <b>Restore</b> button changes the settings back to the last point where you
pressed <b>Set</b>. The <b>Clear</b> button clears all values on the form.
</p>
<p>Note: Enabling more partials than you need does not affect performance
of the synthesizer. The wavetable is calculated once when the project is loaded
and whenever you edit the wavetable. Instruments
using the waveform table do not need to recalculate the waveform repeatedly. However, only enabled
partials are stored in the project file. 
</p>
<p>
Close the editor when finished. To close an editor, select <b>File-&gt;Close</b>
from the main menu, or press <b>Ctrl-F4</b>. Optionally, you can right-click the associated
project item and then select <b>Close</b> from the pop-up menu. You can also right-click
the tab above the editor and select <b>Close</b>.</p>
