<h1><i>BasicSynth Composer</i> </h1>
<p>
<i>BasicSynth Composer</i> is a synthesizer and music scoring program based 
on the <i>BasicSynth</i> sound generation libraries. It includes project management,
 editors for Notelist files and instruments, interactive preview of instrument sounds 
 through a virtual piano keyboard, mixer, and sound generation all in one program.
To get started using <i>BasicSynth Composer</i>, follow the instructions
found in the <a href="stepbystep.html">Step-by-step page.</a>
</p>
<p>Several <a href="examples.html">example compositions</a> are installed with the program. When you
first open the program, the examples are available under the <b>File-&gt;Recent Files</b> menu. Open each project
and then select <b>Project-&gt;Generate</b> to play the compositions.</p>
<p>
This documentation assumes you already understand the basics of sound synthesis.
For those who are just starting to learn synthesis techniques, the following books
will be helpful. These are standard textbooks used in universities to teach sound
synthesis. With a few exceptions, the examples in the books can be easily implemented using the BasicSynth
modular synthesis instrument.

<p><i>Computer Music: Synthesis, Composition, and Performance,</i> Charles Dodge and Thomas A. Jerse</p>
<p><i>Computer Sound Design: Synthesis Techniques and Programming,</i> Eduardo Miranda</p>
<p><i>The Computer Music Tutorial,</i> Curtis Roads</p>
<p>In addition, the two volumes of <i>Musimathics</i> by Gareth Loy are extremely useful in uderstanding
the mathmatical foundations of music and digital sound generation.</p>
